Muse-ical is a social networking-like application catered towards those with interest in all things musical. By creating an account, users will be able to immerse themselves in both learning how to play songs themselves and exploring the work of others. Features will include, among other things, the ability to find sheet music based on songs listened to using the Spotify app, rating the difficulty of said pieces, finding cover videos of songs on Youtube, posting your own musical ventures, connecting with fellow users to share their experiences through a social media app which will be built using HTML,CSS, Javascript,React and Redux at Front end and NodeJs at Back end. As well as expand their repertoire through recommendations and guidance. The objective of this application is to make learning to play an instrument more accessible, and to help connect like minded individuals as they play their favourite songs in their own unique way.

From the research that we have conducted creating our idea, we haven’t seen another platform quite like the one we are suggesting. Granted, apps like Yousician and Simply Piano already exist, but these services offer a pure learning experience. While these apps are only designed to help you learn an instrument, our app will be tailored towards helping you find the music and songs that you are passionate about. The inspiration for our application is based on current offerings such as IMDb for movies, and goodreads for books. Both of these applications offer users a platform to keep track of their favorite content, update and contact their friends and find exciting new suggestions based on their preferences. There are music recommendation applications online, but none that satisfy the utility and the community aspect of services like IMDb and goodreads. Therefore, our exact problem is not currently being solved by any online offerings. As mentioned, this project will give people access to a platform that allows them to connect with friends like a social media app, as well as discover new music. Our project will make life better for passionate music fans who are always on the lookout for new and upcoming songs and artists.

Our project will be entertainment based, with an educational flare for users who wish to expand their musical horizons. Through this project not only will they have the opportunity to discover music but they will have another social media app apart from facebook, instagram, Linkedin etc to look forward to. Additionally during this pandemic, it will give users a chance to spend their time productively by not only connecting with people, but also learning a new skill. The target audience will mainly be musical enthusiasts, anyone from music lovers to your everyday radio listeners including us. Our projects usage will range from a hub for musical enthusiasts, to a social meet up for casual listeners.


App Breakdown

The app will have two main features. First main feature is the social media platform that allows users to interact with one another. Our application will have the ability to post videos or sound files of the user's own cover version, while also being able to rate sheet music based on difficulty for other users to benefit from. Since our app is social media based as well, it will have capabilities such as  liking posts, friending/following others, and linking to other social media.

The second feature that correlates with the first feature will focus on the music aspect. Users will have the ability to find recommended songs based on their music history / background, as well as be able to find free online music sheets for different instruments based on these songs. Furthermore, links to Youtube for cover videos can be found/posted, and these can be used to replay specific sections of the song to help user practice. Some of the educational aspects of our app will be provided by showing the completeness percentage of each song attempted and allowing users access to free drills and technical practice to aid in learning the song .


Potential Stories

The user logs on to our website, and is brought to their homepage. This page will consist of their recent activity on the website, as well as their connections recent activity. The user clicks on their profile and is directed to their personal page where they have their musical preferences, and their current ratings, youtube videos, or sheet music they have viewed. The user scrolls through to find the name of the song that they listened to the previous night which will save their time as they don’t have to search for that song again.

The user logs on to the website and is interested in a song that they have recently heard on the radio. They know the title of the song, so they go to the search bar on the page, and type in the name. They are then shown Spotify's API results for that look up and can now select the song they heard and add it to their music preferences.

The user logs on to our website, and sees that one of their friends has added a song to their personal preferences. The user then clicks on the update, and adds the song to their own personal preferences. Afterwards the user puts a “like” on the update.

The user logs on to the website, and has a song in mind that they heard their friend talk about previously. The user then clicks on the messaging icon, and searches through their friends to send a message to them. They click on the user's name, and are able to send a direct message to that person through the website.



Work Considerations

Concerning the amount of work for this project, we believe that we will be fully occupied for the duration of the project life cycle. The challenging part will be fusing the two main features that are mentioned above. We also need to divide the work in a way that all team members are doing equal proportion of the work. We will also make sure all the team members are contributing towards the project by connecting with our team members every 2-3 days and tracking the progress of the project. In case any group member is found not doing his share of work, we’ll directly report to our professor to address the situation. Our group believes that the listed features will be more than enough for five members given the duration of the development phase. We will also try our best to make our web application better and better with every iteration.
